# Ontology-learning

Since the beginning of the century, research on ontology learning has gained popularity. Automatically extracting and structuring knowledge relevant to a domain of interest from unstructured data is a major scientific challenge. We propose a new approach with  modular ontology learning framework considering tasks from data pre-processing to axiom extraction. Whereas previous contributions considered ontology learning systems as tools to help the domain expert, we developed the proposed framework with full automation in mind.
